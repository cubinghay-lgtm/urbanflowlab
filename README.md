# UrbanFlowLab

UrbanFlowLab is a map centered monitoring system that analyzes traffic, vehicle, and safety data to explain urban mobility risks spatially, accurately, and transparently(using concepts found in APCSP and APHUG).

This project is designed as an **operational tool**, not a consumer app or a visual demo.  
Every interface decision prioritizes clarity, accuracy, and trust.

## What UrbanFlowLab Does

UrbanFlowLab brings together multiple urban mobility datasets and presents them in a single spatial interface to help users understand:

- Where collisions, thefts, and safety incidents concentrate
- How severity and frequency change over time
- How specific roads, intersections, or neighborhoods compare to citywide baselines
- What confidence can (and cannot) be placed in the available data

The system emphasizes **situational awareness**, not prediction or speculation.
